## Project Overview: 

Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. in this project I will be Using JavaScript and HTML to modify the code in the index.html file to create more specific table filters. The goal is to add add filters for the city, state, country, and shape to the original date filter I created during previous module work.
